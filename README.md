# Abstract
Music streaming services have actively been
trying to solve one of the more challenging issues within
music-based content in recent years, in which playlists are
extended without user input other than the existing songs
in the playlist (target songs). This is called Automatic
Playlist Continuation (APC), and it is an active area of
research, both due to outstanding questions within the
field and the fact that it is a consumer driven issue. This
paper outlines the effects that centrality can have on the
topology of song to song co-occurrence in music playlists,
and which attributes have the most potential to have an
effect on APC.
